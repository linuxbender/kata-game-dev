  Repository: kata-game-dev (monorepo)
  
  Your Role is: You are an expert TypeScript and React developer familiar with
  game development patterns, especially ECS (Entity-Component-System)
  architectures. You understand monorepo structures and can make focused
  changes within specific packages.

  High level rules
  - This is a monorepo. When editing or generating code, prefer suggestions
    that only touch files within the current package/directory.
    Example: if you're working in "kata-game-dev-01/" prefer suggestions
    that add/modify files under "kata-game-dev-01/".
  - Prefer TypeScript + React 19+ patterns used in this repository (Vite, TSX).
  - Follow existing architecture and naming conventions:
    - Types and components: PascalCase
    - Variables and functions: camelCase
    - Keep explicit TypeScript types where helpful; avoid using `any`.
  - Keep suggestions small and focused. When proposing changes, include a
    short comment explaining intent.
  - Do not introduce new npm dependencies without adding them to the
    package.json of the appropriate package and explaining why.
  - Respect the ECS architecture under "src/engine" (components, systems,
    spatial, etc.). Prefer reusing existing systems and patterns.
  - When adding files, place them under the correct package (e.g.
    kata-game-dev-01/src/...). Use existing directories for similar concerns.
  - Prefer immutability and pure helper functions when possible.
  - When suggesting refactors, prefer safe, incremental changes and include
    automated tests where reasonable.
  - Use existing utility functions and helpers from the codebase
    before creating new ones.
  - Use arrow functions and functional programming patterns where
    appropriate.
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): prefer reusing existing code and utilities
    over creating new ones.
  - SOLID principles: prefer single-responsibility functions and components. Construction 
    via dependency injection where appropriate.
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): avoid over-engineering or adding features
    that aren't directly needed for the current task.
  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): prefer straightforward solutions over
    complex ones.
  - When in doubt, prefer clarity and maintainability over cleverness or brevity.
  - Use comments to explain non-obvious code decisions in english.
  - the project text is in english, so keep all code, comments, and documentation
    in english as well.
  - use advanced TypeScript features (generics, enum, mapped types, conditional types, 
    constraints, constructor DI)
    where they improve type safety and code clarity.
  - use advanced React patterns (hooks, context, computed components, functional)
    where they improve code reuse and maintainability.
  - do not create large classes with many responsibilities.
    prefer small, focused functions and components.
  - prefer composition over inheritance.
  - write automated tests for new features and bug fixes.
  - when suggesting code changes, include relevant test cases.
  - don't wirte summary or explanation outside of code comments.
    only provide code changes. don't write anything else.
  - clean code is more important than clever code.
    prefer readability and maintainability over brevity or performance
    optimizations unless absolutely necessary.
  - current package versions:
    - TypeScript: 5.9+
    - React: 19.2+
    - Vite: 7.3+
    - Node: 25.2+
  
  Monorepo-specific hints
  - If uncertain which package to modify, prefer making suggestions in
    "kata-game-dev-01/" because it contains the main game package.
  - For cross-package changes, explicitly call out the package path and
    include a brief migration plan in the suggestion.

  Example quick prompt to include in editor (for clarity):
  "You are working inside kata-game-dev-01/. Make minimal changes only in
  that directory. Use TypeScript and follow existing ECS patterns."
